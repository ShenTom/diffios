diffios is a Python library which provides a way to compare Cisco IOS configurations
against a baseline template, and generate an output detailing the differences
between them.

Where more traditional diff tools, such as Python's [difflib](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/difflib.html)
library, consider lines independently and their order as important, diffios
considers hierarchical configuration blocks independently and pays no mind to
the order of the lines, only whether they are present or not, in the same way a
Cisco device would.

This means we can declare our expectations in a baseline template, and then
compare our device configurations against it. diffios will generate an output
which details where our device configurations differ from our expectations.
For elements we expect to vary, such as hostnames and IP addresses, diffios
makes use of variables, and will ignore pre-defined junk lines that bear no
relevance on our configuration.

The goal of diffios is to make the compliance auditing of large network estates
more manageable.

## Installation

Install via pip

```sh
pip install diffios
```

## Usage examples

We'll need a baseline template that we expect all of our devices to conform to.
This can be any kind of text file, `.txt`, `.conf`, `.cfg` or however you store
your device configuration files. It can also be a Python list if you want.

Here we have a simple *baseline.txt* file.

> baseline.txt

```
version 15.3
!
hostname ABC{{ SITE_ID }}RT01
!
!
ip domain name diffios.dev
!
username admin privilege 15 secret 5 {{ SECRET }}
!
interface Loopback0
 ip address {{ LOOPBACK_IP }} 255.255.255.255
!
!
interface FastEthernet0/1
 description *** Link to Core ***
 ip address {{ FE_01_IP_ADDRESS }} 255.255.255.0
 duplex auto
 speed auto
!
interface FastEthernet0/2
 no ip address
 shutdown
!
interface Vlan100
 description User
 ip address {{ VLAN100_IP }} 255.255.255.0
!
interface Vlan200
 description Corporate
 ip address {{ VLAN200_IP }} 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
!
line vty 0 4
 exec-timeout 5 0
 login local
 transport input ssh
 transport output ssh
!
!
end
```

Within this baseline file we can use variables, defined by the double curly
braces (`{{  }}`), in place of changeable elements such as hostnames and IP
addresses.

We can then collect the output from a show run command from the device we want
to compare and save it in a file. Here we have a configuration that has a number
of differences to our baseline.

> device_01.txt

```

Device configurations can often contain junk lines that are going to show up as
differences but that really we don't care about. Lines such as `Building configuration...`.

We can add these lines to a separate file that we pass to diffios as a list of
lines we'd like to ignore. Each line in this file will be evaluated as a regular
expression, so to match `! NVRAM config last updated at 16:10:30 UTC Tue Nov 8 2016 by admin`
we only have to add something like `NVRAM config last updated`.

This file can be named whatever you like, here we have quite sensibly named file
`ignore.txt`. This can also be a regular Python list.

> ignore.txt

```
Building configuration...
Current configuration
Last configuration change
NVRAM config last updated
```

So, now that we have our configurations ready we can compare them.

```python
>>> import diffios
>>>
>>> baseline = "baseline.txt"
>>> comparison = "device_01.txt"
>>> ignore = "ignore.txt"
>>>
# We initialise a diffios Compare() object with our three files.
# The ignore file is optional, and defaults to an empty list.
>>> diff = diffios.Compare(baseline, comparison, ignore)
# From this Compare object we can see the differences between our
# configurations using the delta() method.
>>> print(diff.delta())
--- baseline
+++ comparison

The output above lists the lines of configuration that are missing from our
device but that are present in our baseline template, shown by lines prefixed
with a `-`. Lines that are present in our device that are not in our baseline
template are prefixed with a `+`. Each block is numbered and listed in context
with it's parent line. Currently this output doesn't signify whether the parent
line is part of the difference or only there to provide context.

We can also audit a large number of devices against a single baseline. Below is
an example script that checks every file within a given directory against a
baseline and stores the differences in a CSV file.

```python
import os
import csv

import diffios

IGNORE_FILE = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "ignores.txt")
COMPARISON_DIR = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "configs", "comparisons")
BASELINE_FILE = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "configs", "baselines", "baseline.txt")

# the CSV file we will write to
output = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "diffs.csv")

with open(output, 'w') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, lineterminator='\n')
    # write the headers
    csvwriter.writerow(["Comparison", "Baseline", "Additional", "Missing"])
    files = sorted(os.listdir(COMPARISON_DIR))
    for f in files:
        comparison_file = os.path.join(COMPARISON_DIR, f)
        # initialise the diffios Compare object
        diff = diffios.Compare(BASELINE_FILE, comparison_file, IGNORE_FILE)
        csvwriter.writerow([
            f,
            os.path.basename(BASELINE_FILE),
            # write the formatted differences to the csv file
            diff.pprint_additional(),
            diff.pprint_missing()
        ])
```

The pretty print methods used above format the data in a more readable manner.
We can compare the output from the `additional()` method and the
`pprint_additional()` method.

The `additional()`, and `missing()`, methods return a list of lists that represent
each block that contains a difference.

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> pprint(diff.additional())
[['interface FastEthernet0/1', ' ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.128'],
 ['interface FastEthernet0/2',
  ' ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0',
  ' duplex auto',
  ' speed auto'],
 ['interface Vlan300',
  ' description Corporate',
  ' ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0',
  ' no shutdown'],
 ['ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.2'],
 ['line vty 0 4',
  ' transport input telnet ssh',
  ' transport output telnet ssh']]
```

Whereas the `pprint_additional()` and `print_missing()` methods return strings
that represent all the differences, with each block separated by a newline.

```python
>>> print(diff.pprint_additional())
interface FastEthernet0/1
 ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.128

interface FastEthernet0/2
 ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0
 duplex auto
 speed auto

interface Vlan300
 description Corporate
 ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.2

line vty 0 4
 transport input telnet ssh
 transport output telnet ssh
```
